# Census1990.jl

This is a simple Julia wrapper around a slightly preprocessed portion of the 1990 US Census data.  The datafiles are hosted by UCI: [Census 1990 dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+(1990))

The big data file is `USCensus1990.data.txt`, but there are others that describe the dataset.

In addition to the papers listed at the UCI repository, this dataset is also used in "Fast and Accurate k-means For Large Datasets" by Michael Shindler et al.
