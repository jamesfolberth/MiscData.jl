# Iris.jl

This is a simple Julia wrapper around Fisher's Iris dataset.  The dataset is hosted by UCI: [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)

The main data file is `bezdekIris.data`, but there is also `iris.data`.  Note that `iris.data` contains a couple differences from Fisher's original paper.
